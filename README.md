## 🌟 The Problem

**1 in 10 people worldwide are dyslexic** — nearly 1 billion people affected by a condition that traditional reading tools simply don't address.

### Total Addressable Market

- **~800M people** in the world have dyslexia
- **$5.2B+** market size (growing at ~6.5% CAGR)

The consequences are profound:

- **Low confidence** in reading abilities
- **Poor engagement** with traditional text
- **Lifelong learning gaps** that compound over time

The current educational system is built for readers — not for the diverse ways people think and process information.
